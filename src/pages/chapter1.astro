<TutorialLayout title="Introduction to DayZ Modding" chapter={1}>
  <p>
    Welcome to the first chapter of our DayZ Standalone modding tutorial! In this chapter, we'll introduce you to the world of 
    DayZ modding, explain what it is, and why this guide was created specifically for beginners.
  </p>

  <section>
    <h3>What is DayZ Standalone Modding?</h3>
    <p>
      DayZ Standalone is a survival video game developed by Bohemia Interactive. It places players in a post-apocalyptic world 
      where they must survive against zombies, other players, and the harsh environment. While the base game offers an incredible 
      experience, modding allows players and developers to extend, modify, or completely transform the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modding refers to the process of creating modifications (mods) for the game. These mods can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add new items, weapons, vehicles, or buildings</li>
      <li>Change game mechanics (like stamina, hunger rates, or zombie behavior)</li>
      <li>Add entirely new systems (like base building enhancements or economy systems)</li>
      <li>Alter the map or create new terrains</li>
      <li>Improve or change the user interface</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      DayZ Standalone uses the Enfusion engine, which is different from the older Arma 2 engine used in the original DayZ mod. 
      This means the modding approach is different, using a language called Enforce Script (sometimes called EnScript) rather than 
      the SQF scripting language used in Arma.

    <h3>Why This Guide Was Created</h3>
    <p>
      If you've ever tried to learn DayZ modding, you might have encountered these challenges:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Scattered Information</strong>: Documentation exists but is spread across forums, Discord channels, and various websites.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assumed Knowledge</strong>: Many guides assume you already know programming basics or have modded other games.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Outdated Content</strong>: DayZ has evolved, and some older guides no longer apply to current versions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Complex Examples</strong>: Many tutorials jump straight into complex mods without explaining the fundamentals.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This guide aims to solve these problems by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Starting from absolute zero â€“ no programming experience required</li>
      <li>Explaining concepts in plain language with analogies and examples</li>
      <li>Building knowledge incrementally, chapter by chapter</li>
      <li>Focusing on DayZ version 1.20+ (current as of this writing)</li>
      <li>Creating a practical, working mod that demonstrates key concepts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By the end of this tutorial, you'll have created a functional mod: a clothes storage locker with a code lock. Along the way, 
      you'll learn the fundamentals of DayZ modding that you can apply to your own creative projects.

    <h3>What You'll Need</h3>
    <p>
      Before we begin, make sure you have:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>DayZ Standalone</strong>: The game itself, purchased through Steam (not the free DayZ SA Launcher, which is just a 
        tool for joining servers).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>DayZ Tools</strong>: Available as free DLC on Steam. This includes essential modding tools like the Workbench and 
        Addon Builder.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>A Text Editor</strong>: Notepad++ is recommended for beginners (free), though any code editor works. Visual Studio 
        Code is another excellent option with syntax highlighting for Enforce Script.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Time and Patience</strong>: Modding is a learning process. Don't expect to create complex mods immediately. 
        We'll start small and build up.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You don't need:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Programming Experience</strong>: We'll explain programming concepts as we go.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>3D Modeling Skills</strong>: For this tutorial, we'll use existing game assets.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>A Dedicated Server</strong>: You can test your mod in offline mode.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Our Project: The Clothes Locker</h3>
    <p>
      Throughout this tutorial, we'll be creating a "Clothes Locker" mod. This will be a storage container where players can 
      store items, protected by a code lock. We've chosen this project because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It's practical and useful in gameplay</li>
      <li>It introduces key modding concepts (items, inventory, interaction)</li>
      <li>It requires both config work and scripting</li>
      <li>It's simple enough for beginners but can be expanded with more features</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By the end, you'll have a working mod that you can use in your game or share with others. More importantly, you'll understand 
      the fundamentals of DayZ modding that you can apply to your own creative ideas.

  <Quiz question="What language is used for scripting in DayZ Standalone, and how does it differ from the original DayZ mod?">
    <p>
      DayZ Standalone uses Enforce Script (or EnScript), which is part of the Enfusion engine. This differs from the original 
      DayZ mod which used SQF scripting language from the Arma 2 engine. Enforce Script is more structured, object-oriented, 
      and similar to modern programming languages like C# or Java, making it more powerful but also requiring a different 
      approach to modding than the older SQF scripts.
